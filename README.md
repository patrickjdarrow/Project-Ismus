# Update
- My PC had an irrecoverable failure and all designs/backups were regrettably lost. The project is on indefinitely hold.

# Project-Ismus
Open source robotics -- hardware, software, and 3D design -- for controls education. Founded by myself, with gracious feedback from members of the [East Bay ML Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/East-Bay-Tri-Valley-Machine-Learning-Meetup/).

- **Key Values**
  - *Informative*: to complement the education process and feed curiosity
  - *Accesibility*: 3D-printable, with afforable electronic components
  - *Modularity*: to encourage exploration and customization
